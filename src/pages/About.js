                                <p>Hello! Welcome to LEARN AND SHARE ONLINE! My name is Joe, not my real name but students know and remember me with this name. Iâ€™m the founder of Learn and Share Online English Education which started to operate in 2018.</p>
                                <p>I am a graduate of Bachelor of Science in Secondary Education majoring in English and have been teaching since 2010.</p>
                                <p>Starting an institution for learning was something I could have never imagined. But thanks to the Almighty who has given me inspirations and motivations, Learn and Share Online English Education now fosters English speaker aspirants from China and Vietnam.</p>
